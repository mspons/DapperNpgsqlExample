# DapperNpgsqlExample
Simple demo of using dapper and npgsql together. This is a code 
sample for a blog post at http://www.thespons.net/2015/04/28/dapper-and-npgsql-part-two.html. 

This is just a console application written in C#. It's designed to 
be used with an an already existing (preferably empty) Postgres database, 
but does include table creation and test data population scripts.

The connection string in app.config will need to be modified with the 
appropriate details for your database and database user.
