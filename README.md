# DapperNpgsqlExample
Simple demo of using dapper and npgsql together. This is a code 
sample for a blog post at http://www.thespons.net/2015/04/28/dapper-and-npgsql-part-two.html. 

This is just a console application written in C#. It's designed to 
be used with an an already existing Postgres database, but does 
include table creation and test data population scripts.
